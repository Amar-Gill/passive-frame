-managing services yourself:
    1) Host the database / server
        Managed db service:
            -not recommended if on a budget
            -too expensive
            -e.g. mlab, redislabs
        Host db and python server in virtual private server (VPS) **
            -to host both db and server
            -can set up chron job to backup db if required (in AWS S3)
            -e.g. Dokku (similar to Heroku), vultr, ssdnodes
            -vultr is recommended in video to start
            -see joshtronic blog (joshtronic.com -> VPS Showdown - December 2019)
            -vpsbenchmarks.com <- great way to learn about different providers
    2) Host Frontend
        -Netlify **
    3) User uploaded images
        -recommends a vendor service to handle dynamically resizing images
        depending on application requirements if saved at original size.
        -Cloudinary free tier = 25 credits, 1 credit = 1000 transformations **
        -Imgix $3/1000 master imgs. No cost for transformations.
        -Imgix does not provide storage. Cloudinary does.
